## Personal Background
### Early Life
Plato was born towards the end of the Golden Age of Athens, and at the beginning of Peloponnesian War. He was born to into an aristocratic and influential family. He was educated in philosophy, poetry, and gymnastics. 

At a young age, Plato became a devote follower of Socrates, and actually was one of the youth's that Socrates was accused of corrupting. Following Socrates' death, Plato left Athens and did a bit of soul-searching around southern Italy, Sicily, and Egypt. He spent some time with the followers of Pythagoras. 

Plato eventually returned to Athens (387 BC) and founded the Academy, one of the first known higher education institutions in the western world. It was here that he educated some of his most famous students, including Aristotle.

## Death and Final Years
### Circumstances of Death
Following the end of the Peloponnesian War, a change of government occured to a tyrannical Athenian governemnt called the Thirty Tyrants, who were under the control of Sparta. During this time Socrates was drawn up to serve in Athen's assembly, one of the three branches of ancient Greek democracy (406BC). Here, Socrates was a staunch opponent to the tyranical rule of this government, where on several occassions oppossed the ruling of these tyrants - demonstrating an act of civil disobedience. Martin Luther King even cited this event in his [Letter from Bimingham jail](https://www.history.com/news/kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail-50-years-later).

In 399BC Socrates was arrested and found guilty for impiety, meaning failure to worship the gods, and corruption of the youth. He was sentenceted to death. Whilst waiting for his death, his friends visited him imploring him to escape from jail but he refused, and he "appeared both happy in manner and words as he died nobly and without fear", said Plato. He drunk a cup of brewed hemlock that his executioner gave him, and died surronded by his friends.

Socrates death was well documented in Plato's "The Apology of Socrates".
