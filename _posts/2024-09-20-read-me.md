Hello! And welcome to my personal website. I wanted to put this post together to explain my rationale for creating this site, and as a guide to what you can expect from it. You can think of it as a ReadME file for my website, and if anything does not make any sense, please do get in touch.

## Who am I?

Usually when people get asked this question the go to answer is their professional title, well I'm not going to do that. If you want to know who I am professionally, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-muza/) or [CV](/assets/CV_PMUZA_2024.pdf). Instead, I'm going to list out some of my favourite things, and you can make up your own mind:
- I enjoy science and technology; particularly how discoveries in these fields translate to society.
- I have a keen interest in AI/ML, and its applications in basically everything.
- I enjoy reading books, and I've grown a habit to read two books at a time - one fiction and one non-fiction. Currently I'm re-reading my favourite book, East of Eden by John Steinbeck for the 4th time and Bill Burnett & Dave Evans' Designing Your Life.
- I enjoy sports, I'm a huge Man United fan (yeah I know...), and a Max Verstappen fan (YEAH I KNOW...). I rarely miss a game or a race.
- Pub, of course. 
- Food, who doesn't?
- And finally, I like learning, and I'm always curious. Which is why I've decided to start writing this blog.

## What can you expect to find here? 

A lot of blogging, though I'm not sure of what, I'm still figuring it out. I've decided to start with a few posts on interesting scientific articles and philosophy, eventually I'll branch out to other topics. **The motivation for this blog is to improve my writing and communication skills, and what better way to do this than to write about stuff I find interesting.** 

A key point about my writing is that I want it to be **accessible**, so the challenge will be to distill complex technical ideas into simple concepts. Easy. Oh, and I'll try to keep my writing **concise** and **interesting**.

The layout for science posts will be as follows:
- I'll give an objective summary of the article.
- I'll give my personal opinion of the article.
- I'll discuss how discoveries in the article are relevant to society.

I'll update this post as I go along, and particularly when I start to branch out to other topics.

## What will you not find here? 

I'm not going to post about my personal life, my opinions on politics, or generally controversial issues. You can find that stuff on my [X (formerly known as Twitter)](https://twitter.com/PhillipMuza).

## What's next? 

I'll be writing regularly, expect to see a new post soon and weekly after that.

I want this to be a space to share my ideas and thoughts, but that does not mean that I don't want to hear your ideas and thoughts. **I want this to be engaging**. So please feel free to comment, to critisise, and to share your ideas and thoughts on any of my posts.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you find something of value here.

Phillip :)
