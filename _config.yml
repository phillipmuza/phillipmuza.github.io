  This is a personal website, for me, Phillip/Phil.
  Here you will find out a little bit about me.
  The interesting, the mundane, and the weird. Really, a glimpse into my psyche.
  But importantly, blog posts on science, philosophy, and whatever else I find interesting.
  New blog posts will be published regularly, stay tuned!
